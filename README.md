## About

Hello World, I am a Full Stack Web developer with a focus on front end UX/UI and CSS. Design is my passion and I aim to create clean and beautiful web applications.

I have a passion for open source software, CSS and design, and building cool things. I am a privacy advocate and aspiring cypherpunk, looking to contribute to opensource projects wherever possible. 

When I am not coding you can find me hiking, skiing or snowboarding deep in the mountains. 

## Projects 

I'm currently working on improving my front end design and UX/UI skills and making beautiful figma designs for all the app and website ideas I have bouncing around in my head. 

My current side project is an algorithmic trading bot which I aim to share with the world upon completion. I love open source code and I want to build things for other people to use. I live to help others and want to share information that I find valuable with the world.
